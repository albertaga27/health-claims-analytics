- History of anxiety disorder, currently stable

Current Medications:
- Albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed

Recent Hospitalization (September 2025):
Chief Complaint: Acute exacerbation of COPD with increased dyspnea
Duration: 3-day hospital stay
Treatment: IV corticosteroids, nebulizer treatments, oxygen therapy
Discharge: Stable condition with home oxygen therapy prescribed

Current Symptoms:
- Persistent cough with clear sputum production
- Mild dyspnea on exertion, improved from admission
- Fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance
- Occasional chest tightness, relieved with bronchodilator use

Diagnostic Results:
- Chest X-ray: Hyperinflated lungs consistent with COPD, no acute infiltrates
- Arterial blood gas: pH 7.38, PaCO2 45 mmHg, PaO2 68 mmHg on room air
- Spirometry: FEV1 55% predicted, FVC 75% predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio 0.73

Plan:
- Continue current bronchodilator therapy
- Pulmonary rehabilitation referral
- Home oxygen therapy 2L/min as needed for oxygen saturation <90%
- Follow-up with pulmonologist in 2 weeks

Risk Factors:
- Former smoker (quit 3 years ago, 15 pack-year history)
